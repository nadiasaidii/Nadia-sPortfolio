  <h1>My Reflection</h1>
  <br>
  <h4 style="text-align: justify;"> 
    <p> Creating my own website has always been my dream and a great and meaningful experience for me. This individual assignment, from IMD311 has taught me a lot of new interesting things regarding the creation of website as i discover more on my own and by the slides given by Madam Seri Intan Idayu. I am very grateful to learn this course with our beloved lecturer. Thank you for always being attentive towards us. Conceptualization, design, and implementation taught me digital communication, creativity, and personal growth, as well as technical skills. My website creation presented challenges, insights, and personal growth, which I will discuss in this reflective essay.</p>

<br>
<p> Inspiration struck me, a simple yet elegant theme I wanted to share with the world. This first stage involved brainstorming, researching, defining the website's purpose and audience, and laying the groundwork for the project. After conceptualization, design and development began. Design decisions became crucial. As I sought to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, colours, fonts, and layout became more important. Coding and configuring the website makes me learn new technologies and overcome obstacles. A fully functional website was difficult to achieve as bugs, design issues, and content creation required problem-solving and persistence. Despite each challenge, I learned to solve problems and be resilient. Web development's iterative nature promoted continuous improvement and adaptability.</p>
<br>
<p>     Finally, building my website went beyond technology. Self-discovery, skill development, and community building ensued. My challenges, skills, and connections shaped my personal and digital identity. This transformative experience made me see the website as a digital artefact and a testament to my growth and adaptability in the ever-changing digital world.</p></div>
